### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Xander Kuijpers, and I'm currently doing a 4 years course in order to become a Software Developer. All of my GitHub school projects will be publically linked on this profile. I'm hoping to become a succesfull software developer some time, and to work for popular game industries in the future.
