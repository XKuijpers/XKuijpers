### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Xander Kuijpers, and I'm currently doing a 4 years course in order to become a Software Developer.

All of my GitHub schoolprojects will be publically linked on this profile, and I hope to become a successful software developer in the future, so I can work for popular web industries in the future.
